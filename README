vCoins is a plugin that creates a basic foundation for a virtual currency system, which seems redundant, because Terraria already has currency, but due to the limitations of only having a server mod, you can not alter the inventory in such a manner to remove the coins. That is where this plugin comes in. It allows mods to use vCoins as currency, so other plugins can trade items for vCoins without a player having to be there.
